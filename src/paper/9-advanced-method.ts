To get an even more accurate estimate for Person Risk, we can actually add up the risk (in microCOVIDs) of their recent behavior. Remember, a single microCOVID represents a one-in-a-million chance of getting COVID.

The **Advanced Method** is to add up the risk of each individual activity that person has done recently.

The [spreadsheet](/spreadsheet) is a tool that can help you add up activities in the Advanced Method.

Just like you can calculate this for each of your actions, you can also calculate it for your friend’s actions, using the same formula:

<p class="calloutText">Cost = Activity Risk ⨉ Person Risk</p>

We can do this by looking at all of their activities between 2–9 days ago[^12] and determining the risk of each individual activity. Or if they do the same things every week, what does their typical week look like?

This is an advanced method because it requires asking about—and calculating the risk of—each of your friend’s recent or typical errands, hangouts, and other activities. And you might have to ask about your friend’s contacts too!

## Add up the person’s socializing, errands, and work

We suggest thinking about this in three categories: socializing, errands, and work. To calculate total Person Risk using the advanced method, you can add these three categories together, as follows:

<p class="calloutText">Person Risk (Advanced) = Socializing + Errands + Work</p>

Note that this formula uses addition, whereas everything else we’ve done until now has been multiplication.

For socializing, just estimate each social activity in microCOVIDs (using “Cost = Activity Risk ⨉ Person Risk”) and add them together. This is the place to count the exposure from all their household members as well.

Errands include grocery shopping, transit, and other public settings. These can be harder to estimate individually; we have some guidelines in the [Q&A](13-q-and-a).

     Note that this figure includes both _presymptomatic_ transmissions (where the person transmitting COVID will eventually show symptoms, usually within a few days, but hasn’t yet) and _asymptomatic_ transmissions (where the person transmitting will never show symptoms). Catching COVID from someone _presymptomatic_ is much more common: this accounts for about 50% of all transmissions, as opposed to _asymptomatic_ transmissions which account for only about 5%. The COVID discourse tends to muddy this fact somewhat. Asymptomatic infections are inherently harder to measure (because you probably won’t get tested if you don’t show symptoms), and there are indeed plenty of them. However, most of them don’t infect anyone else. Thus, they don’t wind up affecting our risk calculations that much.

[^5]:
     The most-infectious period starts a couple days after infection, but the day-to-day noise in new case numbers is enough that “0-7 days ago” and “2-9 days ago” are unlikely to be meaningfully different. We’ve found Figure 2 in [Ferretti et al](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6491/eabb6936) most helpful when thinking about this.

     As an example, New York City in March–April 2020 was completely overwhelmed by COVID, with widespread reports that even people with obvious and severe symptoms were unable to receive a test. We’ll look specifically at the five boroughs plus Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk counties, an area containing 12.2 million residents. A survey for COVID antibodies in these counties performed between April 25–May 6 [found](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html) that 23% of people had previously been infected, but according to the [Johns Hopkins dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map) only 263,900 cases (2.2% of the area’s population) had been officially recorded by May 1.

[^7]:
     Note these are _contagiousness-adjusted_ underreporting factors: that is, we think the total number of infections might be 6x the reported number of cases, but additionally that the unreported infections are somewhat less contagious (due to containing a higher proportion of asymptomatic individuals), so we adjust this factor down. See [Research Sources](14-research-sources) for our full methodology and reasoning here.

[^8]:
     With this low of a positive test rate, an even lower underreporting factor is quite plausible, but we don’t have enough data to estimate just how low we should go.

[^9]:
     Tip: if your data source lists a “7-day moving average” of cases on a certain day, the number of cases in the preceding week is just 7 times that.

[^10]:
     This seems high to us: a 5107-in-a-million chance over a week-long period of getting COVID from being an average SF resident implies the average SF resident has a 23% annualized chance of getting COVID. That seems pretty bad. We really hope we’re wrong somewhere and the real number is lower; perhaps we don’t need as high as a 6x underreporting factor anymore?

     We derive this from data about US essential workers, and from a blanket testing initiative in the Mission District in San Francisco. First, we use data from [McNicholas & Poydock Table 4](https://www.epi.org/blog/who-are-essential-workers-a-comprehensive-look-at-their-wages-demographics-and-unionization-rates/) showing that around 55 million people in the US are essential workers (38% of workforce and 17% of the population); we sanity-check this against [another source](https://bayareaequityatlas.org/essential-workers) citing 28% of workers in the Bay Area are essential workers. In [Chamie et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20132233v1.full.pdf)’s blanket testing survey of residents in the Mission District in San Francisco, they found a positive test rate of 5% among frontline service workers and 0.8% among non-frontline workers (6.27x higher for frontline workers). The overall prevalence is a population-weighted average: \`prevalence_total = 0.17 x p_essential + 0.83 x (p_essential / 6.27)\`. From this we compute \`p_essential = 3.3 x prevalence_total\`. We round off to 3x for essential workers, and 0.5x for all others.

     The reason we care most about their activities between 2–9 days ago is because that is the most likely range of time intervals between infections. ([He et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5), figure 1c middle graph; [Ferretti et al](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6491/eabb6936) “generation time”). See [Research Sources](14-research-sources) for graphs and more about the infectious period.
