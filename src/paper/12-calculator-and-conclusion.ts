### Calculator

While it's good to know how the math works, it can be a bit drudgerous to actually sit down and do it for every activity you're considering. With that in mind, we developed a [calculator tool](/calculator) to help you estimate and multiply the Person Risk and Activity Risk, including any modifiers for safer behavior (like wearing a mask), to get an estimated number of microCOVIDs from a given activity. Just give it your location and tell it about the activity you'll be doing, and it will tell you the “cost” of that activity in microCOVIDs.

We think it’s especially powerful as a way to hone your intuition. Try putting some of your activities from last week into the calculator. Which activity had the largest cost? How many microCOVIDs do your actions add up to?

### Conclusion

We hope our mindset towards COVID risk modeling helps you feel less trapped and more free to live a safe(r) COVID life.

If you have more questions, check out the supplementary [Q&A section](13-q-and-a) coming up next, and/or the [Research Sources](14-research-sources) section after that.

If your questions aren't answered in the supplementary material, or if you'd like to offer feedback or are interested in contributing to the project, please [contact us](/contact). We would love to hear from you!
