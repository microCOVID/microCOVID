      <p>
        The {spreadsheet()} is a tool to help you with two things that the{' '}
        {calculator} is not quite powerful enough for:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first is to{' '}
            <b>
              calculate someone's{' '}
              <Link to="/paper/6-person-risk">Person Risk</Link>
            </b>{' '}
            using the <Link to="/paper/9-advanced-method">Advanced Method</Link>{' '}
            as described in the white paper. The Advanced Method consists of
            adding up the person's risk in from their behaviors in the last 2-9
            days. The spreadsheet makes it easy to add up the activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second is to <b>track your own microCOVIDs</b> over a longer
            period of time. You might do this for a few reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>assessing your own risk,</li>
              <li>
                communicating with others about your risk status (e.g. by
                sending them a link to a sheet listing your recent behavior)
              </li>
              <li>
                creating agreements with others in your household (or bubble or
                pod) about how many microCOVIDs you are allowed to "spend"
                outside the household in a week or a month.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The {spreadsheet()} includes a few multipliers that we mention in the{' '}
        <Link to="/paper/13-q-and-a">Q&A</Link> section but did not include in
        the main text or in the {calculator} for simplicity, such as better
        masks. Other than that, each row on the spreadsheet does exactly the
        same thing as the {calculator}.
      </p>

      <p>{spreadsheet('Use the spreadsheet here')}</p>
