  	<p>You’re already familiar with some rules of thumb for avoiding COVID-19 infection: wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart, and only socialize outdoors. But just how much do these things help? What happens if you get closer than 6ft? Is it safe to eat at a restaurant indoors? It’s tough to make good choices when you don’t know how large or small the risks really are.
  	</p>

	<p>We—the authors—were really struggling with this. We wanted a rigorous way to make decisions about COVID risk. So we trawled the scientific literature for data and spent hours estimating the COVID risk of various activities. 
	</p>

	<p>
	This website contains the output of that research: <b>a <a href ="https://www.microcovid.org/calculator/">calculator</a> that you can use to calculate your COVID risk, a <a href ="https://www.microcovid.org/paper/">white paper</a> that details our methodology, and a <a href ="https://www.microcovid.org/spreadsheet/">spreadsheet</a> to track your COVID risk over time.</b>
	</p>

	<h3><a href ="https://www.microcovid.org/calculator/">I. The Calculator</a></h3>

	<p>Based on our findings, we created a calculator to assess “cost” in microCOVIDs of various activities. We hope you’ll use it to build your intuition about the comparative risk of different activities and as a harm-reduction tool to make safer choices.</p>

	<p>The “cost” of any given activity is based on several factors including: the prevalence of COVID in your area, how many people you’re with (for how long), and whether you’re inside or outside (with masks or not).</p>

	<p><i>Note: This calculator works best if you live in the United States and are not at high risk of severe complications from COVID. We did not focus on society-wide pandemic dynamics, policy responses, or suggestions for public health officials.</i></p>

	<h3><a href ="https://www.microcovid.org/paper/">II. The White Paper</a></h3>

	In the white paper we show:
	<ul>
		<li>How we measure COVID infection risk, in units of “microCOVIDs”</li>
		<li>How risky we think various common activities are</li>
		<li>How you can estimate the COVID risk of your own actions (using our handy-dandy <a href = "https://www.microcovid.org/calculator">COVID risk calculator</a>)</li>
		<li>And, most importantly, how to make decisions that balance freedom and fun with safety and health.</li>
	</ul>

	

	<h3><a href ="https://www.microcovid.org/spreadsheet/">III. The Spreadsheet</a></h3>

	<p>After you're done exploring the calculator and the white paper, you can begin to track your COVID risk on a spreadsheet. We recommend starting with the calculator and white paper before diving into this.</p>
