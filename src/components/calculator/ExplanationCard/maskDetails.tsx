        Here are the different mask types ranked from most protective to least
        protective:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          [P100 + Goggles] &gt; N95 &gt; KN95 &gt; Surgical mask or mask with
          PM2.5 filter insert &gt; Cloth mask / bandana / buff
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        For maximum protection, goggles and face shields provide additional
        protection for the eyes, which are another possible site of infection.
      </li>
      <li>It’s vital that your mask forms a tight seal around your mouth.</li>

          It is VERY important to learn how to make sure your mask{' '}
          <a href="https://youtu.be/5-Ihvw5X3ks?t=57">fits properly</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          No facial hair where the mask touches your face! Wearing an N95 over a
          beard is no better than wearing a surgical mask.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        P100 respirators provide you the best protection but are cumbersome and
        thus only ideal for high-risk scenarios.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Note that P100 respirators have an outflow valve, which means you are
          not protecting others. To fix this, put a surgical mask or cloth mask
          over the outflow valve.
        </li>
        <li>
          P100s come with a range of possible filter cartridges. We recommend
          the basic particle filters, not the VOC filters, which are harder to
          breathe through and do not provide additional protection.

        N95 masks and KN95 masks provide very good protection IF AND ONLY IF you
        get a good seal. You also need to be careful to get a reputable brand.

        Surgical masks are very cheap and widely available, as are masks with
        PM2.5 filter inserts. They are both an easy upgrade over cloth masks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cloth masks provide very limited protection to you, but still provide
        good protection to others. Of the various cloth materials,{' '}
