          The calculator introduces a new concept, the microCOVID. One
          microCOVID is a one-in-a-million chance of getting COVID. An activity
          that’s 20,000 microCOVIDs is very unsafe, as you have a 2% risk of
          catching COVID <em>every time you do it</em>. An activity that’s 20
          microCOVIDs is relatively safe, as you could do it every week for a
          year and still have only about a 0.1% chance of getting COVID. If you
          want to keep your chance of getting COVID down below 1% a year, you’ll
          want your weekly budget of activities to sum to less than 192
          microCOVIDs each week. We’ve created a handy{' '}
          <a href="/spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a> that lets you keep track of
          your activities over time.
