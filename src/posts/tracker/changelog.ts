    title: 'Increase podmate budgets if everyone is vaccinated',
    spreadsheetURL:
      'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Es4ZzLlNiBSxG5jJsGPUYewrCw2NqB5kDXlNfmdSdD0',
    whatsNew: `
* New: Increase individual budgets if everyone in the pod is vaccinated since household transmission is less likely. Follows the [formula outlined here](/paper/13-q-and-a#2-if-a-vaccinated-individual-contracts-covid-how-much-less-or-more-likely-is-this-to-result-in-negative-consequences-increased-budget). ([#1013](https://github.com/microCOVID/microCOVID/issues/1013))
* New: Activity Risk now caps at the partner level (60%) instead of the housemate level (40%). ([#1012](https://github.com/microCOVID/microCOVID/issues/1012))
* Bugfix: Handles the case where we don't have vaccination data for a location, and the users selects "Avg local resident (vaccinated)" as the risk profile. ([#1037](https://github.com/microCOVID/microCOVID/issues/1037))
* Bugfix: Corrects the name of the *HEPA filter* location type to include "per hour". ([#968](https://github.com/microCOVID/microCOVID/issues/968))
* Bugfix: Now correctly ignores "environment" when distance is set to "close" ([#1033](https://github.com/microCOVID/microCOVID/issues/1033))

**Note on how the vaccination budget adjustment works:** This feature reduces the impact of other podmate's activities on each persons' budget, since transmission is lower between podmates now that you are all vaccinated. If some people in the pod are not vaccinated or received different types of vaccines, you have two main options. Let these two examples illustrate.
  * **Example A:** 5 podmates got Pfizer and 1 got J&J. The pod has a 1% annual risk budget. The person who got J&J doesn't mind being exposed to a bit more than 1% per year. So we set this setting to "Pfizer" because most people got Pfizer. This will set individual budgets that, if completely used, will put the housemate with J&J at above 1% risk of getting COVID. In this particular scenario, the podmate with the J&J vaccine may be exposed to up to a 0.07% chance of getting COVID per year.
  * **Example B:** 5 podmates got Pfizer and 1 got J&J. The pod has a 1% annual risk budget. The person who got J&J definitely wants to stay under the 1% total budget. Therefore, the pod chooses "Johnson & Johnson" for this setting. Everyone doesn't get as much of an increase to their budget, but you all stay under the 1% annual budget.

_Since this is such a large change, these instructions show you how to make a new copy of the spreadsheet and migrate your data over to it._

_Steps_
    
1. **Make a copy** of the [latest version of the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aCj6tkxC70sT9WBwLjBYFxbr_eLbAv8FPF-fjrBtdaU#gid=1845362878)
2. **Podmate names:** Copy-paste the names of each of your podmates (Pod Overview > row 20)
3. **Locations:** Copy-paste your location settings. (Location > B6 through E26)
4. **Custom People data:** Copy-paste the columns from your Custom People sheet (from ‚ÄúIs this a generic person profile that should be adjustable by location?‚Äù to ‚ÄúVolume‚Äù)
5. **Activity Log data:** Copy-paste the columns from your Activity Log  (from ‚ÄúPodmate Name‚Äù to ‚ÄúVolume‚Äù)
6. Delete your old spreadsheet (File > Move to trash). (Or alternately, you can rename it and make it clear to anyone who opens it that they should go to the new copy.)
7. Notify all your podmates of the new URL.

_Less common settings you may also want to migrate:_

1. Copy-paste your risk budget choice (if it‚Äôs something other than default).
2. Copy-paste each of your shared budget reductions (Pod Overview > rows 65-63)

_Note: Known Issue with vaccines:_ The vaccine logic will apply your vaccination bonus to your interactions with your podmates slightly before what is strictly accurate (starting 7 days after your vaccination, the sheet will retroactively apply the vaccination multiplier to current microCOVIDs from housemates). The fix for this is too complicated to be deemed worthwhile.
* Example: a housemate who gets 100microCOVIDs 6 days after your vaccination will, 8 days after your vaccination, show up as 100 * .3 * .5 * .56 = 8.6 microCOVID instead of 100 * .3 * .5 = 15 microCOVID
* Workaround: If you must avoid under-reporting at all costs, enter the date of your vaccine 1 week later than you actually received it.
