# General Q&A

### How should I choose my annual risk budget?

We currently have two main risk budget options. You are, of course, welcome to choose any risk budget for yourself. 

| Title                   | Risk of getting COVID per year                                     | Weekly microCOVID budget   | Suggested for..                                                       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard Caution Budget | 1% chance of getting COVID per year <br /> = 10,000 microCOVIDs per year  | = 192 microCOVIDs per week | Healthy people NOT in close contact with more vulnerable people       |
| High Caution Budget     | 0.1% chance of getting COVID per year <br /> = 1,000 microCOVIDs per year | = 19 microCOVIDs per week  | Suggested if you or your close contacts are more vulnerable to COVID. |

[Vulnerability increases with age.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html) We think age over 60 confers substantial increased vulnerability to severe illness from COVID. [Certain underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html) also confer increased vulnerability:

*   BMI of 30 or higher
*   Type 2 diabetes mellitus
*   Smoking
*   COPD or other heart conditions
*   Cancer
*   Chronic kidney disease
*   Immunocompromised from solid organ transplant
*   Sickle cell disease



**Risk to you & risk to others**

When choosing your budget, you want to factor in  two important aspects: risk to _you_, and risk to _others_.

*   **Risk to you:** If you are in the under-40 age bracket and do not have other risk factors, then a 1% chance of COVID per year puts your risk of disability due to COVID at about the same level as your risk of disability due to driving a car. See below for how we arrived at the [1% annual risk budget](#how-did-you-arrive-at-a-1-annual-risk-budget).


*   **Risk to others**: Even if you are personally comfortable with risk-taking, it’s important to choose a lower risk tolerance in order to protect vulnerable members of your community. Here are a few ways to think about that:
    *   If you get COVID, on average you will pass it to at least one other person, who in turn will pass it to others. Eventually it will reach someone who is at very high risk of death. By avoiding getting infected yourself, you are protecting these vulnerable members of your community.
    *   A useful ethical rule-of-thumb is to behave in a way that would be good if _everyone_ behaved that way. So, we can ask: what risk tolerance would keep the pandemic at manageable levels if everyone followed it? In most places in the US right now, a 1% yearly risk of COVID would keep the pandemic at manageable levels. For public health reasons, we wouldn’t recommend voluntarily choosing a risk tolerance higher than 3%.


    *   Some people (such as essential workers) have no choice but to run a high risk of getting COVID. Containing the pandemic across society only works if those of us who _do_ have a choice choose to take fewer risks.

### How did you arrive at a 1% annual risk budget

We think as many as 1 in 10 COVID cases could potentially lead to long-term negative health consequences for the infected person; we don't think the ratio is likely to be higher than that, due to sources like the app-based [COVID Symptom Study](https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-long-term) that found one in ten cases weren't fully recovered after 3 weeks. That would mean that a 1% chance of COVID is the same as up to a 0.1% chance of ongoing negative health consequences from COVID. The average American drives [13,476 miles per year](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm). In 2018 [there were](https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/tsftables/National%20Statistics.pdf) 2,491,000 car-crash-related injuries (of any severity) spread across 3,240,327,000,000 vehicle miles travelled (see the [NHTSA website](https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/tsftables/tsfar.htm) for more detailed breakdowns). [A study of Swedish car crash injuries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256772/) found that 11.4% of them met the criteria for at least “1% permanent medical impairment” five years later. (“Permanent medical impairment” is a [legally-relevant concept](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/understanding-permanent-disability-rating-system.htm) that attempts to quantify disability, and the 1% level was the lowest level of disability that was discussed in the Swedish car crash study.) Multiplying this out, we get a 0.11% chance of ongoing negative health consequences from driving for one year.

You may choose to follow a different risk budget. Here is some information that might be helpful in deciding what is right for you:
  * Among people under 40, the chance of death from COVID is about 0.1-0.2% ([Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-age))
  * Among people over 60, this rises to 2-3% and doubles with every 10 years over 70.
  * A 0.1% chance of death is equivalent to...
    * Driving 100,000 miles ([IIHS](https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state))
    * Base jumping 3 times ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASE_jumping#Safety))
    * 167 skydiving jumps ([Skydive California](https://skydivecalifornia.com/blog/skydiving-statistics))

Also remember that, if you take on personal risk, you also present a risk to others. Take care to isolate from others who do not consent to your risk tolearnce.


### If there’s a precaution I don’t see a multiplier for here, should I still do it?

Yes, definitely! The most important such precaution, in our opinion, is communication around symptoms:
- Ask people _directly and clearly_ if they have any symptoms, _right before_ hanging out with them. Even if they only have “mild” symptoms that seem like “nothing to worry about,” consider if you can take a rain check, or at least [MODify](3-covid-transmission#mod-hangouts-masked-outdoors-distance) your hangout.
- If you have any more concerning symptoms[^1] then _immediately_ notify anyone you saw in the past 10 days, and contact your doctor for medical advice.
- If a household member develops more concerning symptoms, follow [CDC best practices for home isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html) straight away while you contact a doctor for medical advice.

Other important precautions include washing & sanitizing your hands, covering your sneezes with your elbow including when you are at home, using a better-fitting mask, and wearing eye protection (we particularly recommend wearing goggles and a P100 mask if you are looking for extra safety when shopping!)

# Activity Risk Q&A

### What if I hang out with someone indoors for a long time? If we hang out for 5 hours, that’s an Activity Risk of 6% ⨉ 5 = 30%, which is the same risk as for a household member.

In the case of a long indoor hangout, we suggest just to cap the total Activity Risk at the household member number (30%). Or if you’re cuddling or being intimate, cap the total Activity Risk at 48% as mentioned above for spouse/partner. These are not particularly principled answers. As we’ve mentioned in footnotes before, the ability to just add microCOVIDs (rather than multiplying probabilities) starts to break down as probabilities get larger. Additionally, the data we’re basing our guesses off is more relevant to the smaller risks that we more commonly see with typical activities. Certainly don’t use an Activity Risk larger than 100% for anything.

### If you live with multiple people, do you account for the additional risk of a longer infection chain within the household?

No. We’ll explain what this means and why we don’t account for it in the specific case of a single household.

Imagine I live with Alice and Bob. Alice gets sick. There are two things that could happen next that could get me sick:

1. I get it _directly_ from Alice.
2. I don’t get it from Alice, but _Bob_ does. Then Bob infects _me_!

There’s a \`30%\` chance that I get sick directly from Alice. There’s a \`70% * 30% * 30% = 6%\` chance that the second scenario happens instead. So you might think the total risk to me should be more like 36% than 30%.

We currently don’t model this effect, and we think that’s pretty safe if (and only if) you and your household members are conscientious about monitoring for symptoms and isolating from one another at the first sign that someone in the house is feeling unwell. Such isolation should include some reduction in contact between the household members that still feel fine, since one or more of them might have become infected by the unwell person before their symptoms appeared.[^unwell]



Here’s why isolating helps reduce this source of error:
* Prompt isolation means it’s less likely[^isolation] I get it directly from Alice, _and_ less likely that Bob gets it and can pass it to me.
* Even if Bob ends up getting sick, Bob and I can start avoiding each other immediately, as soon as Alice gets symptoms. Although it’s quite possible for Alice to give COVID to Bob before Alice has symptoms, it’s much less likely for Bob to pass it on to me _before Alice has symptoms_.[^2]

As a result of these considerations, we don’t think we’re making a huge error by using the unadjusted 30% number for the Activity Risk of having a house hold member.

Of note here: while full isolation is the gold standard for reducing infection risk, it’s useful to also have some lighter-weight tools that you can deploy if you’re uneasy about infection risk for some reason but not uneasy enough to find hard isolation to be worth the (admittedly considerable) social and practical costs. Extrapolating from the [MOD factors](3-covid-transmission#mod-hangouts-masked-outdoors-distance), we think wearing a mask around the house for several days probably reduces your risk of infecting your housemates by about 4x, which is a lot of protection to get from a relatively simple intervention. In the authors’ household we deploy this one if we’re feeling at all unusual, even if the symptoms (such as a scratchy throat) aren’t suggestive of COVID; or if we’ve recently done something moderately higher-risk than usual.

### Why do I need to account for my household members? I thought it was “free” to hang out with people as often as I want, so long as they’re all in the same “bubble”?

So long as the people in your “bubble” have some risk of getting infected from anywhere, the risk they pose to you contributes to your total microCOVIDs.

In short, we think “closed quarantine bubbles” are a good strategy for very-low-risk groups who don’t venture outside the house often, but make less sense for larger bubbles with more exposure to the outside world.

To spell it out a bit more: If nobody in your bubble has any exposure to other people or public spaces outside the bubble, then in fact you can count their Person Risk as very minimal.[^3] This isn’t a magical property of the bubble being "closed" per se; it’s a result of everyone only socializing with other people who also have very minimal Person Risk. Seeing a friend who lives completely alone and literally never leaves the house would also keep you at this same low risk level. The “closed bubble” framework is a way to coordinate around maintaining a very low risk level together.

But if people in the bubble are doing things that expose them to others somewhat—going to work, grocery shopping, taking trips—then even if they aren’t meeting up for coffee, dates, or events with anyone outside the bubble, they still have some nonzero Person Risk, and you should multiply this with the Activity Risk of seeing them.

This means that, if the people “in your bubble” have some exposure to the outside world, then reducing your _total_ amount of contact is likely more important than making sure you are only seeing people in your bubble.

To summarize, _reducing your total amount of contact_ (and choosing to socialize only with other people who are also reducing _their_ total amount of contact) is (we think, for most people) the most important strategy for staying safe.

### So if my housemate really wants to see a partner in another house, you believe it is sometimes better from a risk standpoint not to negotiate for the partner’s entire house to get added to a closed bubble with us?

Right! To illustrate, compare the following two scenarios:

1. The two houses merge into one large “bubble”. Everyone gets together for a full group dinner between the two houses.
    * This could be quite a large gathering, where everyone is exposed to everyone. If any of these people have been to work, on public transit, or in stores, then everyone at the dinner is indirectly exposed to those external sources of risk.

2. No specific bubble arrangement, but nobody else in your house socializes with anyone else in the other house. Just your housemate sees just their partner, in the partner’s room with the door closed.
    * One person is exposed to one other person. This is less overall contact.
    * Of course, if you choose not to make a “closed bubble” agreement, the partner might be doing other socializing of their own.

Which strategy is less risky depends on which factor dominates: the partner’s other socializing, or every bubble member’s combined external exposure. This is why we think closed bubbles are the safer choice for people who are generally not working outside home or going out at all, and reducing total contact is the safer choice for people who have a moderate amount of external exposure. We haven’t done the math on this yet, and we would be interested to see an analysis of this.

##  MOD: Masked, Outdoors, and Distance

### I was told to wear masks to protect others, not myself. Do masks actually protect me?

Yes! Cloth masks and surgical masks protect others more than they protect _you_ (see [Research Sources](14-research-sources)), but they still reduce your risk of catching COVID by half, so they’re well worth it even from a selfish perspective.

### What about masks that provide more protection, like an N95 or P100 respirator?

These masks provide more protection than a cloth or surgical mask:

* Masks that claim to have N95-like filter media (e.x. KN95, Vogmask), can be considered equivalent to KN95's - designed to filter, but not rigorously quality controlled or tightly fitted. These receive a 6x protection factor.

* For a well-fitted, well-sealed N95, we roughly estimate an 8x reduction in risk for the wearer (versus 2x for a surgical mask or high-quality cloth mask).
  * But remember, these masks are only effective if you get a tight seal around your face! Just “wearing an N95” doesn’t protect you all the way. We have seen a friend of ours “wear an N95” that was much too big for their face, leaving a big gap under their chin. Other friends have worn an N95 over a beard, but facial hair definitely prevents a good seal. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306645/) shows that even a pair of tiny points of leakage a couple of millimeters in diameter dramatically increases the number of aerosol particles that can pass through a high quality mask. Please do a [seal check](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-130/pdfs/2018-130.pdf) and watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoSb-HJJ5tk) in order to effectively use your N95.

* A P100 is even better. We estimate that P100's provide a 20x recuction in risk. 
  * A major reason we like P100s is they are easier to get a good seal on. You can search for online training on how to do this.
  * Note that P100 respirators typically have an outflow valve, meaning they provide minimal protection to others from you, so if you use a P100, you may be legally required to cover the  outflow valve with cloth or a surgical mask.


### What P100 do you recommend?

We absolutely love the GVS Elipse. They're available <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gvs+elipse+ebay">on eBay</a> for $60-90.

### Is it reasonable to just multiply together all the modifiers? 8x for masks, 10x for outdoors, and 2x for 6ft of distance?

Each of these modifiers changes the total number of particles that might reach you, so we do think it’s reasonable to keep piling them on _somehow. How exactly_ they combine is not precisely clear. But if you consult the [Research Sources](14-research-sources) section, the masks and distance modifiers were estimated from data including healthcare settings where they were sometimes combined.

The “outdoors” modifier is the one we have the least confidence of. At larger distances, we speculate that outdoors might provide _more_ than 20x protection, because particles have more time to diffuse upwards into the vast empty space above everyone’s heads, whereas indoors small particles could hang in the enclosed room air. On the other hand, at smaller distances (especially at close range: cuddling, tango dancing, etc.) we don’t have any reported data that we feel sheds light on how much of a protection factor there might be, so we suggest _not_ to use the 20x modifier for outdoor interactions with unusually close range or with other factors associated with superspreader events (yelling, dense crowds, etc.).

# Person Risk Q&A

### Are people who work outside the home riskier than people who work from home?

We do not think that, as a blanket rule, every person who works outside the home is riskier than every person who works from home. Activites outside of work play a major role in a person's chances of contracting COVID.

For instance, a Healthcare Worker who wears a sealed N95 mask while seeing one unmasked patient at a time for 40 hours per week, but does not see any other people in a typical week, would be calculated as follows:
\`average_risk * 40 hours * 9%/hr * 1/8 (N95) = 0.45 * average_risk\`

Therefore, this worker could be less risky than the average person in the area (although the final risk will depend on what else they are doing in terms of chores and socializing).

We recommend using the [Advanced Method](/paper/9-advanced-method) to estimate the risk of all your close contacts, rather than using blanket risk categories. The [Risk Tracker](/tracker) is an excellent tool for keeping a tally of one's personal risk. The microCOVID team includes a Primary Care Provider who tracks and reports her risk using this tool, which suggests that her weekly risk is on the order of 100microCOVIDs per week.

We originally proposed an "Intermediate Method", in which people who work outside the home are guestimated at 2x or 3x the population average. This was based on the following two studies:
* [Chamie et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.20132233v1.full.pdf) found a 6x higher positive test rate among frontline service workers.
* [Data from Washington State](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/IndustrySectorReport.pdf) suggested Heath and Social Service workers had been infected at 2x the average rate.

However, we have retracted this method for the following reasons:
* These studies include data early in the pandemic when COVID-19 was poorly understood and good PPE was unavailable.
* It appears that the average person has become significantly riskier since early in the pandemic (more social activity / less lockdown yields high overall rates).
* These categories of people are highly heterogenious. Lumping them all together makes no sense.
  * Differences in PPE alone can reduce transmission risk by 10x, which would be a larger effect than either of these studies.
  * Many hospitals have precautions that decrease the liklihood that a random healthcare worker will be exposed to COVID.
  * On the other hand, some healthcare workers directly work with confirmed COVID patients, which is a much higher risk category.
* Various studies, such as [Baker et al.](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-7145) have shown that, for at least some pockets of healthcare workers, healthcare workers are no more likely to get infected through their work than the average person is to get infected through socializing.
* The above Washington State report shows that people who work outside the home got COVID at about the average rate for the state.

# Vaccines Q&A

## How should we think about people who have been vaccinated?

***Summary**: Vaccinated people receive a multiplier on all incoming microCOVIDs from their activities. The multiplier depends on which vaccine they've gotten and is contingent on having waited long enough for their immune system to respond. Additionally, each microCOVID *may* be 2-4x less likely to land a vaccinated individual in a hospital.*

People who have been vaccinated are less likely to catch COVID and transmit it to others, which results in them getting fewer microCOVIDs from activities.
However, they are not totally immune to COVID, and it is quite easy for a vaccinated person to counteract the decreased risk per activity by doing lots of
risky activities (for instance, the Moderna vaccine confers a 1/5x multiplier for incoming microCOVIDs, so a vaccinated person who does 5x more risky behavior
after being vaccinated would be just as many microCOVIDs as before).

There are two questions that are important for understanding vaccines:

1. How much less likely is it for a vaccinated individual to catch COVID? This determines the ***reduction in microCOVIDs*** a vaccinated individual receives from a given action.
2. If a vaccinated individual contracts COVID, how much less (or more) likely is this to result in negative consequences (hospitalization or death). This determines how much a person can ***increase their microCOVID budget*** for being vaccinated (on top of being able to do more activities from part 1).

### 1. How much less likely is it for vaccinated individuals to catch COVID? (Reduction in microCOVIDs)

We do not know for sure how likely it is for a vaccinated individual to catch COVID. Vaccinated individuals still have a chance of becoming sick (even if they are not seriously ill), and may be asymptomatic carriers of the virus, capable of infecting others without having symptoms themselves. None of the vaccine studies have directly addressed what the chances of transmission from a vaccinated individual are. We attempt to make educated guesses by pulling in other sources. For our derivation of these numbers, see the [Research Sources](/paper/14-research-sources#vaccines).

|             | microCOVID multiplier 7 days after 1st dose | microCOVID multiplier 14 days after 2nd dose |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| AstraZeneca | 0.56                                        | 0.4                                          |
| Moderna     | 0.56                                        | 0.2 [^moderna]                               |
| Pfizer [^pfizer] | 0.56                                   | 0.2                                          |

For perspective, the first dose of either vaccine confers equivalent protection as wearing a good quality cloth mask all day, every day *on top of your actual mask* and *even when you normally couldn't wear a mask*. Completing the 2nd dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine confers more protection than wearing a surgical mask 24/7, and Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine is as protective as wearing a KN95 mask all the time.

While the vaccines are nowhere near making you invulnerable to COVID, remember that these vaccines are absolutely game-changing — universal vaccination would reduce *everyone’s* chance of catching COVID by 50% or more. This will (likely) reduce the rate of community spread to the point that every week has fewer cases than the last (R<1). The end of the pandemic is in sight. 

### 2. If a vaccinated individual contracts COVID, how much less (or more) likely is this to result in negative consequences? (Increased budget)

At first glance, among all vaccinated individuals across all 3 studies, only 1 case of severe COVID-19 was observed, with no hospitalizations or deaths. However, there were only a small number of severe cases in the control group, which means we cannot say with much certainty how effective the vaccines are at preventing severe COVID-19. One might squint at the data and suggest that the reduction in severe cases is 2-4x the reduction in microCOVIDs suggested above.

Additionally, we have seen [data](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/ryct.2020200110) suggesting that asymptomatic COVID-19 could result in lung damage in half of cases.

As a result, getting a vaccination yourself confers a reduction in incoming microCOVIDs (as outlined [above](#1-how-much-less-likely-is-it-for-vaccinated-individuals-to-catch-covid-reduction-in-microcovids)),
but we do not recommend increasing your microCOVID budget on top of that given current data. This may change as more data about the vaccines is gathered.

If you do decide you want to increase your microCOVID budget post vaccination,
* Discuss this with any regular close contacts you have, such as housemates, partners, or co-workers — your increased risk of COVID, asymptomatic or not, could affect them more than it affects you.
* Consider the potential impact on your community at large — taking on more risk of being an asymptomatic spreader could result in you infecting many other people.

### So is a vaccinated person safer to be around than an unvaccinated person?
Not necessarily. A person's risk is the product of their precautions and activities. It is true that a vaccinated person who does the same activities as a unvaccinated person will be less risky to be around. However, if the vaccinated person starts doing more risky behaviors, they could end up being more risky than before they got vaccinated! The only way to accurately understand a person's risk is to model each of their activities and multiply that total by the modifier from the table above. The [Risk Tracker](/tracker) makes it easier to do this.

# Specific Activities Q&A

### Can I let a friend use the bathroom in my house?

We believe that if the person is indoors for <5 mins and wears a mask the whole time, then the risk will be negligible for all but the most cautious risk budgets. This is especially true if you can open a window to ventilate the bathroom space. See [this article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-it-safe-people-use-bathroom-coronavirus_l_5ef43b8fc5b66c3126820ec8) for more tips about this.

### Silence? Singing, chanting, yelling? Speaking loudly? Exercising?

Based on the [Jimenez Aerosol Transmission Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16K1OQkLD4BjgBdO8ePj6ytf-RpPMlJ6aXFg3PrIQBbQ/edit#gid=519189277), we could contemplate up to a 5x reduction in risk for silence, and a 5x penalty for singing, chanting, yelling, or speaking loudly; plus an additional 5x penalty for heavy exercise.

### Are small rooms riskier than large spaces?

Yes! Based on the [Jimenez Aerosol Transmission Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16K1OQkLD4BjgBdO8ePj6ytf-RpPMlJ6aXFg3PrIQBbQ/edit#gid=519189277) and estimates of the total area of rooms of different sizes, we think you might consider the following multipliers:
×4 _higher_ risk for a ‘tiny room’ (~10ft across)
×2 for a ‘small room’ (~15ft across)
×1 for a ‘normal room’ (~20ft across)
×0.5 for a ‘large room’ (~30ft across)

These assume you are already sufficiently distanced (at least 6 feet) that the size of the room is relevant to the amount of aerosol you’ll breathe. In close quarters, we think the size of the room has less of an impact.

### Should I use an extra multiplier for cuddling? Going on a date?

We personally use an additional multiplier of at least 2x for cuddling, Our original take on this was based on the assumption that our data for infection risk under “no particular distance” (which were largely collected in hospitals) reflect a distance closer to 3 feet than 0 feet. If each additional 3 feet adds a 2x improvement in safety, then being right on top of each other (0ft apart) might involve a 2x reduction in safety. This looks consistent with recently released data from train passengers sitting directly adjacent to one another versus merely in the same row ([Hu et al.](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1057/5877944)). If you’re breathing right into each other’s faces, more so than train passengers would, maybe use a higher number.

We think it doesn’t make sense to take the full “outdoor” bonus when cuddling, because your faces are very close together. Finally, we think a brief hug probably doesn’t meaningfully change your risk, but we don’t have any evidence for that. Basically, we really don’t know and don’t have any evidence here, so take this with more grain of salt than the rest of our more-research-backed numbers.

We don’t have an additional multiplier for kissing. A one-time hangout combined with the cuddling multiplier is already an Activity Risk of 2 ⨉ 6% per hour = 12% per hour, which makes two and a half hours of cuddling appear riskier than having a roommate. As a side note, it seems to us that masked sex might be a lot safer from a COVID standpoint than making out without masks... provided you actually have the willpower to keep your masks on!


### Cuddling and hugging aside, is it risky to touch the other person if we remain a normal socializing distance apart?

We don’t feel we have enough data to fully model this risk. But if we assume you aren’t changing how far apart you are, then we think that hand-to-hand touching is more risky than other kinds of touch. Any type of touch is safer if you wash or thoroughly sanitize your hands both before and after touching.

If you’re within hand-holding distance of someone, and you reach out and touch their hand, it does _not_ change your chance of inhaling a respiratory droplet, because your faces didn’t really move. What _does_ change is the chance that any virus that’s on their hands (from rubbing their nose or coughing) could get from your hands into _your_ eyes, nose, or mouth (when you touch your face). Touching hand-to-hand seems likely to be riskier for this route than other types of touch (such as clasping forearms, giving a shoulder massage, or a brief hug with faces averted).

The CDC says that contact transmission is not a main driver, but we haven’t yet seen research on this topic we feel we can trust. For our house, we’ve learned to treat our hands as “contaminated” any time we’re outside the house, and to wash our hands as soon as we get home. As such we don’t currently add an extra budget factor for touching or not. You could perhaps assume that touching bare hands adds another 2x factor (which is as much as we use for cuddling) if you expect you won’t manage to wash your hands before touching your face, but we’re entirely making that up and we don’t use it in our estimates. We don’t have a better suggestion we can stand behind right now.

Touch is a psychologically powerful way to show affection and appreciation. In our experience, outdoor masked hand-holding has a huge positive impact on our mental health and feeling of connection, as compared to assiduously not touching one another. Feeling “touch starved” [is a real thing](https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/relational-and-health-correlates-of-affection-deprivation) with real psychological effects, and for many people we think touch is a good use of your risk budget.


### How do I count receiving a package?

We don’t currently count microCOVIDs from packages, because of our understanding that fomite transmission is not a primary driver of the spread; most of our risk comes from time we spend indoors with others. People maintaining much lower annual risk levels than us might prefer to sanitize packages to maintain a stricter risk tolerance.

Health officials are often quoted as saying the risk from packages is “[very low](https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/HealthU/2020/03/26/can-you-get-coronavirus-from-packages-and-mail/)” and “[unlikely](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html),” but until they quantify that in microCOVIDs we’re just going to proceed with assuming it’s less than 1 microCOVID per package. We do know there’s [no known evidence of transmission from food packages](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-during-emergencies/shopping-food-during-covid-19-pandemic-information-consumers).

### Lyfts/Ubers?

You’re indoors, about six feet away from one other person (the driver), and both of you are hopefully wearing masks. It’s an unusually tiny space with poor air circulation by default.

We did some informal tests with a CO2 meter in a Lyft[^4], and found that if you crack the windows open by an inch or so, this makes it “just” as well ventilated as a normal indoor space, rather than much stuffier than usual. So we suggest to at least crack the windows, then count it like an indoor space. If they’re chatting or talking on the phone, you might consider politely asking them not to.

If you keep the windows all the way open, the air circulation according to our CO2 meter is just about as good as being outdoors, so you’ll probably reap some of the benefits of being outdoors. We wouldn’t recommend taking the full 10x outdoor modifier for a windows-open Lyft, since it’s unclear how much of the safety of outdoor interactions is due to factors like UV light that aren’t present inside a car. But 2x or so might be reasonable.

### Public transit?

You can very conservatively treat transit as an indoor hangout with however many other people are in the bus or train car with you, continuing to take a decrease of 2x per additional 3 feet away that the people are. You’re also probably up to 5x safer in the likely event that nobody is talking (but if anyone starts yelling, which happens on public transit sometimes, you could be 5x _less_ safe). Overall, [very few transmission clusters](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/there-is-little-evidence-that-mass-transit-poses-a-risk-of-coronavirus-outbreaks/) have been linked to public transit.

### Airplanes?

Unlike transit, airplanes have pretty good air filtration systems: all the air is replaced with new air from outside every 4–5 minutes, and all the air passes through a HEPA filter that eliminates 99.97% of particles (the same as a P100 respirator) every 2–3 minutes ([source](https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/how-airplane-cabin-air-works)). That means your risk will primarily be from people near you.

The exact numbers for the Activity Risk will depend on how full your flight is; we’ve used 20 people at 6 feet of distance as a reasonable estimate for a moderately full flight. The worst case of a middle seat on a totally packed flight might be twice as bad as that:
- Two people right next to you: potentially equivalent to about 8 people six feet away (though there’s a lot of uncertainty about risk at extremely close quarters)
- Six people in the rows ahead of you and behind you, about 3 feet away: equivalent to about 12 people six feet away
- 21 other people within two rows of you (five full sets of 3 seats across the aisle, one that’s two rows ahead of you and one two rows behind), all of which are about six feet away
which adds up to 41 people. (The plane is divided into “zones” of 5–7 rows each with separate climate control systems, so 5 rows worth of people — yours, two in front of you, and two behind — is a pretty good estimate for how many you’re potentially sharing exhalations with). As with public transit, you probably get some benefit from the fact that few of the people around you are talking, though it’s hard to say how much. Anything you can do to reduce the number of people near you (such as flying at an inconvenient time, paying for a reserved or extra-legroom seat, or even buying a first-class ticket) will help reduce your risk.

For the Person Risk, we suggest you use the maximum prevalence of your source or destination region.

What about the _airport_ rather than the plane? We still suggest you wear a high-quality mask. However we also note that airports are huge spaces and at the time of writing we’re still at only about [20% of the passenger volume per day](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1107016/coronavirus-tsa-checkpoint-travel-numbers-us-airports/) compared to what we saw last year—with decreases in demand, the flights get fewer but the airports don’t get smaller. It’s also easier to distance in the airport. Our intuition is that most of your risk comes from the plane.

Overall, there are very few documented cases of transmission on airplanes, which is surprising given that 500,000 or more Americans are flying every day at the time of writing (which, if we naively assume current US-wide prevalence rates, would mean ~100 COVID-positive passengers per day). We are aware of [one flight in China in January 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20040097v1) that infected 12 people, [one case in February](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194574/) probably acquired on a flight, and [one flight in March from London to Vietnam](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/07/04/886788377/international-flights-are-ramping-up-slowly-and-with-plenty-of-caveats) that infected 13 people. Erin Bromage has written more on [flying in the age of COVID-19](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/flying-in-the-age-of-covid-19).

### Grocery stores? Drug stores? Haircuts?

For grocery stores, we count the average number of people near us: in our neighborhood this is usually about 5 people, keeping 6 feet away, everyone wearing masks. For drug stores, pharmacy pickup, or medical buildings, you might want to add an extra boost to Person Risk to account for the fact that the people you’re encountering are more likely than average to be sick.

Haircuts can be modeled by counting each person in the hair salon. We definitely recommend wearing the best mask you have that won’t interfere with the haircut, and checking in advance that your mask style will be fine. If your stylist is usually chatty, we suggest for an extra safety margin to ask the hair stylist to chat less! We found an anecdote [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/robshirkey/status/1269369868182315014) about 140 clients who were in close contact with two infected hair stylists, indoors, with both client and stylist wearing masks. 45 clients were tested – all negative – and we haven’t heard of any cases among the others. Last we checked this was statistically consistent with the Activity Risk and modifier suggestions we use in this writeup.

### Going to a protest?

The risk of attending a protest depends on how close you get to others, whether they are yelling/chanting, whether they are wearing masks, and other factors we have not modeled in this writeup (for example, we have heard anecdotally that it is lower risk to be in a group where people are moving constantly, rather than staying near the same people for a long time). If you are in a shoulder-to-shoulder group of yelling people without masks, you might be near 10 people within 6 feet: Activity Risk = 6% per hour ⨉ 10 people ⨉ (1/10 outdoors) ⨉ 5x yelling (see earlier in Q&A) = 30% per hour. Alternately, if you are in a group of cyclists protesting by biking down the road banging drums and gongs, that might be more like Activity Risk = 6% per hour ⨉ 10 people ⨉ (1/10 outdoors) ⨉ (1/5 silent) ⨉ (1/2 at least 6ft away) = 0.6% per hour. This is a 50 times less risky activity. There are many ways to protest. We encourage you to keep all the same heuristics in mind: if possible, avoid very dense crowds, yelling, and enclosed spaces; and wear masks to protect yourself and others.

The most important thing to remember in attending a protest is that you may not have control over what happens to you. Police might [pull your mask off](https://nypost.com/2020/05/31/nypd-cop-pulls-mask-off-man-pepper-sprays-him-in-the-face-video/). If pepper spray is used, people are likely to cough uncontrollably. You might get [kettled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettling) into a small area, even if you were planning to keep your distance from others. One thing you can do to help stay safer is to make a plan in advance about what you will and won’t do: for example, you might decide in advance that if you see any gas used near the protest, you will leave. By thinking about what you are and are not up for, and making choices that take into account the risks, we hope you can confidently and proudly participate in protests that make sense for your risk tolerance.

### How do microCOVIDs relate to initial dose?

"Initial dose" — sometimes referred to as “[initial viral load](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2020/04/01/taking-initial-viral-load-seriously/)” — 
refers to how big a “dose” of virus you get when you first get exposed to the virus. If you’re exposed to more viral particles, evidence suggests that you’re more likely to develop a severe infection. This means it’s important to try to reduce the strength of your initial exposure, not just in order to avoid getting sick.

For the same total number of microCOVIDs, our guess is that getting them from many smaller independent sources (many mask walks, numerous brief grocery runs, etc.) is more likely to involve a low initial viral dose than getting them from fewer riskier contacts (household members who don’t take many precautions; cuddling a random person whose recent activities you don’t know).


### Are there other similar models or scales?

Here are some quantitative analyses we like:

*   Peter Hurford of Rethink Priorities created a [COVID Risk Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBZWHEk2Jo-IFvZK_smrwYoOTOykB7H-oHb0qYjg2ys/edit) which we really like. His approach is entirely compatible with ours, although he uses some different numbers. The tool outputs a risk of COVID infection in terms like “1 in 578” which is easy to convert by multiplying by a million to e.g. 1730 microCOVIDs
*   Prof. Jimenez from Univ. of Colorado-Boulder has an [aerosol transmission estimator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16K1OQkLD4BjgBdO8ePj6ytf-RpPMlJ6aXFg3PrIQBbQ/edit#gid=519189277) in a Google Sheet that informed many of our numbers. Unlike our analysis, this sheet uses detailed assumptions about the dynamics of particles in the air. Each tab gives a risk of infection for a specific scenario.
*   The [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/well/live/putting-the-risk-of-covid-19-in-perspective.html) has an easy-to-digest discussion of COVID risk in terms of micromorts.

In terms of qualitative scales, we like the following:

*   The interactive guide at [COVID - Can I Do It?](https://covidcanidoit.com/US/all), where you can plug in an activity and see its risk breakdown in terms of crowding, respiratory droplet formation, time, and ventilation.
*   The diagram of [red/yellow/green activities](https://twitter.com/SaskiaPopescu/status/1279133758965248000/photo/1) by Popescu et al. which was featured in a FiveThirtyEight article about [risks and decisionmaking](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-decision-is-a-risk-every-risk-is-a-decision/).



[^1]:  More concerning symptoms include cough, chest tightness/discomfort, obvious sore throat, body aches, malaise, loss of taste/smell, nausea/vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, any subjective “feverish feeling” or elevated temperature, fainting, or thermometer reading of >100.4.
[^unwell]: You probably can't do this anywhere near as reliably with someone you don't live with, which is why the discussion here is specific to housemates.
[^2]: This is due to the fact that much less transmission occurs more than 3 days before the appearance of symptoms ([He et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5), figure 1c middle graph) or fewer than 2 days after infection ([Ferretti et al](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6491/eabb6936), figure 1 “generation time”). In order for Carol to infect Bob before Alice shows symptoms, Carol’s generation time would have to be greater than the delay between Alice’s infectiousness and Alice’s symptoms, which is unlikely.
[^3]: When we do these calculations, the lowest Person Risk we allow ourselves to assign anyone is 1/100th the Intermediate Person Risk, just as a safety margin.
[^moderna]: Moderna's Phase III study was only designed to count participants who got symptomatic cases of COVID. Our multiplier is based in part on data from testing all participants on the day of the second dose. Since the immune response after the second dose appears to be significantly stronger than after, this number could be as good as 0.05. Moderna is collecting additional data which may affect these numbers.
[^pfizer]: Pfizer's Phase III study also does not report asymptomatic COVID cases. We use the same numbers as Moderna because the metrics that _are_ reported are quite similar, and the design of the vaccines themselves are quite similar. The multiplier after the 2nd dose could be as low as 0.05 or as high as 0.45. Pfizer is collecting additional data which may affect these numbers.
[^4]:  [Jimenez’s aerosol transmission tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Enmh7DJZ8kN8Ia6yDOsPs42Y-jlsp7R8Hwy7LiUUJO4/edit#gid=154529406&range=A106:B106) lends some support to the idea of using CO2 as a proxy for density of exhalations.
[^isolation]: Perhaps a _lot_ less likely that I get it from Alice if Alice isolates promptly: [Li et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/32301964) found that isolating an infected household member from the rest of the household as soon as they showed symptoms was effective in _all_ the 105 cases they studied at preventing anyone else in the household from getting sick.
