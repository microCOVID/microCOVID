You’re already familiar with some rules of thumb for avoiding COVID-19 infection: wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart, and only socialize outdoors. But is it riskier to go to the grocery store, or to ride in a Lyft or Uber? It’s tough to make good choices when you don’t know how large or small the risks really are.

We, the authors, were really struggling with this. We wanted a better way to make decisions about COVID risk. So we read some papers and crunched some numbers. We spent hours building a model to estimate the COVID risk of various activities. And in this writeup, we’ll share our model (and some practical tools!) with you.


We’ll show you:

- how we estimate COVID infection risk, in units of “microCOVIDs”
- how risky we think various common activities are
- how you can estimate the COVID risk of your own actions (by hand, or using our handy-dandy [calculator](/calculator))
- and, most importantly, how to make decisions that balance living your life with safety and health.

You’re in the target audience of this white paper if you are comfortable with numbers and want to think about how your personal choices affect your chance of getting COVID-19. We are not focusing on society-wide pandemic dynamics, policy responses, or suggestions for public health officials.

<p>We have based our numbers in this writeup on published scientific research. However, unlike a medical or scientific standard of evidence, we state our best guess based on available evidence, even when that evidence is far from conclusive. Our goal in doing so is to enable ordinary people to do back-of-the-envelope calculations to make personal decisions. For scientific data, please see the <a href="14-research-sources">Research Sources</a> that we have used in forming our guesses.</p>


<p>We have read a lot of experts' research, but we are not ourselves experts in this topic. This is not a primary source of new information about COVID. This work has not been scientifically peer-reviewed. There is still a lot of uncertainty about COVID. Do not rely on this tool for medical advice. Please continue to follow government guidance.</p>
