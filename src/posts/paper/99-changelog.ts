    title: 'Omicron variant vaccine updates',
    content: `
Made first-round updates for Omicron.

* Vaccines
  * Efficacy of vaccines vs any infection has greatlly decreased.
  * Added the option to have a booster dose.
  * Pfizer / AstraZenica data was drawn from Ferguson et al., Table 3.
  * Pfizer multiplier changed to 1, 0.8, 0.25 with 1, 2, or 3 doses respectively.
  * AstraZenica changed to 1, 1, 0.3.
  * Moderna / Sputnik is assumed to be similar
  * Johnson&Johson data is from Gray et al., calculated from data in table 1 as (Number of positive COVID19 tests With Vaccine / Number of tests With Vaccine) / (Number of positive COVID19 tests without Vaccine / Number of tests)
    * New multipliers are 1, 0.95 with 1 or 2 doses.
  * To handle mixed-vaccines, we are only looking at the most recent dose. This is a simplification to make the UI and research manageable. In reality, e.g J&J followed by Moderna is probably a little worse than 2 Modernas while Moderna followed by J&J is probably a little better than 2 J&Jâ€™s.
  * We acknowledge that vaccine efficacy decays over time. We will attempt to add this to the model in the near future.
* Other mutlipliers
  * We do not have data to change other multipliers at this time. It is possible that the hourly base rate should be a bit higher. If you have contact tracing data that suggests a new housemate or hourly transmission rate, please send it our way.

* Vaccine updates:
  * Added support for Johnson & Johnson's vaccine (single dose, 1/3 multiplier).
  * Improved multiplier for Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines (0.2 -> 0.1) based on new data.
  * Increase wait time before getting the effects of a vaccine (7 -> 14 days). This matches Moderna / AstraZeneca / Johnson & Johnson (Pfizer's was the only study that used 7 days).
  * See [Research Sources](/paper/14-research-sources#vaccines) for rationale.`,
