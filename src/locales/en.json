An activity that’s 20,000 microCOVIDs is very unsafe, as you have a 2% risk of getting COVID <i>every time you do it</i>. An activity that’s 20 microCOVIDs is relatively safe, as you could do it every week for a year and still have only about a 0.1% chance of getting COVID. We decided an annual risk budget of a 1% chance of catching COVID per year was reasonable for most healthy people who are not in contact with vulnerable groups. To learn how we arrived at that number, <1>click here</1>. If you want to follow this 1%-risk-per-year budget, you’ll want your weekly budget of activities to sum to less than about 200 microCOVIDs each week. We’ve created a handy <3>spreadsheet</3> that lets you keep track of your activities over time."
